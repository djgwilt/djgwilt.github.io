# Use Alt + Arrow keys to re-order the lines, moving them

# Main Program
##########################################
# ==> Allow the user to enter a numerator and a denominator 
#     as two separate whole numbers, in that order. [1]

# ==> If the denominator is zero, print 'Infinity' [0]
    
# ==> Otherwise, if the numerator and denominator are 
#     the same, then print the word 'One' [1]

# ==> For all other cases, print the numerator divided 
#     by the denominator, rounded to two decimal places. [2]

# ==> Create the variable called 'data' as an empty list [0]
data = ??

# Choose the correct next line to allow the user to enter a whole number. 
# ==> Uncomment one line only. [0]
#amount = int(input("How many words will you enter?"))
#amount = float(input("How many words will you enter?"))

# ==> Fill in the ?? to create a loop that will run 'amount' number of times [0]
for count in ??(0,amount,1):

# ==> Inside the loop, ask the user to 'enter a word' and add the number of 
#     letters in the word to the end of the list called 'data' [0]
word = ??("Enter a word:")
num_letters = ??(word)
data??(num_letters)


# The longest word can be found with the python code 'max(data)'. 
longest = max(data)

# ==> Change the ?? in the format-string below so that after the loop, 
#     the length of the longest word is printed [0]
print("The longest word has length ??".format(longest))
